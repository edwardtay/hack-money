# AI-Assisted Development

This project was built with Claude Code (Anthropic CLI) as a coding partner.

## My Contributions
- Product vision: "One link to accept any crypto into your preferred token"
- Architecture decisions: ENS as payment config, LI.FI for routing, vault zaps for yield
- Protocol design: `ensio.strategy`, `com.pay.config` ENS text record schema
- Smart contract specifications and deployment strategy
- Testing with real funds on mainnet (ETH, Base)
- Transaction verification and debugging failed routes
- UX decisions and user flow design
- Hackathon strategy and prize targeting

## Claude's Contributions
- Code implementation (React, Next.js, Solidity)
- LI.FI SDK integration code
- ENS resolution and text record parsing
- Debugging build errors and API issues
- Code refactoring and cleanup

## Process
All development done via **Claude Code CLI** with human oversight on every commit. I directed the architecture and made all product decisions; Claude wrote the implementation code.

Built for HackMoney 2026.
